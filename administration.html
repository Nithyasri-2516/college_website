             It is promoted and supported by Virudhunagar Hindu Nadars' Devasthanam, various Hindu Nadars' Mahamai Tharappus in Virudhunagar and other places and educational institutions of Virudhunagar. 
             The management of the institution consists of the elected members of various Mahamai Tharappus and ex-officio members of various educational institutions of Virudhunagar.
             The office bearers, the president, the vice-president, the secretary, the joint secretary and the treasurer - are elected by the managing board members.
             Our College is ideally located on the home land of Karmaveerar "Bharat Ratna" K. Kamaraj and our institution is one of the Virudhunagar's most recognisable landmark. Our beloved Patron Thiru.A.S.K.A.M. Nagarajan magnanimously donated 50 Lakhs and Our Founder Secretary Er.S.P.G.C. Srimurugan has donated 25 acres of Land for the progress of our college. Our Institution is growing with sustained progress due to the generous contributions from Virudhunagar Devasthanam, Various Mahamai Tharappus and Educational Institutions. Presently, Our College spans to 47.92 acres of land.

              "THAMASOMA JYOTHIR GAMAYA - FROM IGNORANCE TO LIGHT"

              Education plays a significant role in breaking the shackles of ignorance. It offers knowledge, knowledge that is not merely bookish or tutored, but the knowledge that enables us to achieve original understanding.
              
              Educating students is part of the college's fundamental mission. While working with them, I discover in many cases their education, stretch beyond the classroom and prepares them for careers and professional life. While our college's programmes are rigorous, additional professional and personal growth results from experiences outside the classroom- in plant trainings, clubs and competitions.
              
              Updating new skills have become the order of the day. Only a person willing to learn new things can see the problems and challenges in their right perspective and offer lasting, sustainable and comprehensive solutions.
              
              A rare combination of youth and technology is driving a wave of change in the developing nations. Our country is heavily dependent on youth power. With this in mind, we encourage each member of our educational system to work together to provide the highest quality educational program possible. I am proud to state, "Kamaraj College of Engineering & Technology is a positive place where everyone learns and succeeds. We believe in the philosophy "Teamwork makes the dream work."
